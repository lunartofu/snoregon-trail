# The Snoregon Trail

The Snoregon Trail is a game created by Tracy Lee for UC Berkeley's Spring 2017 Psychology of Sleep course. It is intended to be both educational and entertaining but may, regrettably, be neither of those things; you can judge for yourself by [playing it at this link](http://www.tofuturtle.com/projects/psych133).

## Mechanics
By clicking the corresponding button, the player controls the sleeping patterns of a mostly-unseen character. You continue until the character dies.

## Shortcomings
The code is a little messy because I originally planned for the game to have more complex logic with how fatigue was calculated and how events were structured. The approaching deadline meant that I had to gut maybe 75% of what I wanted to do, but a happy accident is that the final resulting simplicity is truer to the inspiration for this game, Oregon Trail. I tried to make up for the mechanics by making as many bad meme references and puns as I could come up with.

While all the probabilities of events are greatly exaggerated to make the game more interesting, sleep *does* affect health, both favorably and adversely.
